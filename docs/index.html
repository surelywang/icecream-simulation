		<h2>Progress So Far</h2>
		<h4>About our proposal...</h4>
		<p>After receiving feedback on our project proposal, we realized we had to modify our project because a real-time 3D simulation with OpenGL would have been terrible to try and figure out. Instead, we have decided to try and simulate melting ice cream using WebGL and Javascript. As of now, we are not trying to incorporate ice cream melting by temperature, adding any toppings, or any other fun features. Our main focus is to create a 2D simulation </p>

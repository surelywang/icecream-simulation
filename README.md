# icecream-simulation
A simulation of a scoop of ice cream melting off of a cone, using THREE.js and WebGL.

Users can toggle between different texture mappings (e.g. different flavors of ice cream) and control the melting rate that the scoop of ice cream melts at!

To run the simulation locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/surelywang/icecream-simulation.git
2. Open up src/main.html in your browser.
3. Play with the simulator! You can toggle between different textures and melting rates.
